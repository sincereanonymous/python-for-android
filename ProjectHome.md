This is Python built to run on Android devices. It is made to be used together with SL4A (Scripting Layer For Android).
Nearly all the actual non-python specific documentation can be found at [android-scripting](http://code.google.com/p/android-scripting/)

Feel free to use our [Python For Android Support and Discussion Group](http://groups.google.com/group/python-for-android) for any Python related questions. If your question is related to SL4A then do it at [SL4A Support and Discussion](http://groups.google.com/group/android-scripting).

For Python specific issues and enhancements _only_, please use the issues tab.
